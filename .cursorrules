# Git Commit Guidelines

## Commit Message Rules
- All git commit messages MUST be written in English
- Keep commit messages short and concise (50 characters or less for the subject line)
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adding feature")
- Be concrete and direct - describe what the commit does, not why
- Start with a capital letter
- Do not end with a period
- Use present tense

## Examples of Good Commits
- "Add user authentication"
- "Fix navigation bug"
- "Update button styles"
- "Remove unused imports"
- "Refactor auth context"

## Examples of Bad Commits
- "Added some stuff" (not specific)
- "Arreglar bug" (not in English)
- "Fixed the bug that was causing issues with the login form when users tried to authenticate" (too long)
- "fix bug" (not capitalized)
- "Add feature." (ends with period)

## Additional Guidelines
- If you need more detail, use the commit body (separate from subject with blank line)
- Focus on WHAT changed, not WHY (use PR descriptions for context)
- One logical change per commit when possible
